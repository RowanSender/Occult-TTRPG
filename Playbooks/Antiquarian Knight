Background

Templar
You or your ancestor was a knight sworn to a holy Order that participated in a crusade on behalf of the Church. Name this Order. Do you still owe them any obligations? 
	Abjure the Dark
	Your armor was blessed at some point during it's history. When Hold Steadfast against a creature of the Dark, you may roll roll +will instead of +Constitution. If you do, you add the following to the list of options you can choose. 
		○ Light flares from within you, blinding and hindering the creature for a moment. 
Veteran
You were of the last generation of nobles that would be raised and trained as Knights. You served a lord and rode into battle on their behalf. Name that lord. Do you still owe them any obligations?
	Pull Rank
	When you command an ally, tell them what you want them to do and roll +Will.
		○ 10+: they take +1 ongoing to all rolls while made while trying to carry out that task.
		○ 7-9: they take +1 forward on their next roll while trying to carry out that task. 

Sanity and Madness Moves
Choose one of the following dualities. While Sane, you always have the sanity effect active and vice versa with Madness. 
Sane	Mad
You are particularly adept at maintaining your armor. You may ignore the first time your armor would be damaged, if it is at its full armor value. This cannot occur again until you have spent time maintaining your equipment. 	You become obsesses with the condition of your armor. Your armor only grants you +1 Guard, as you purposefully take blows wrong to prevent damage to your armor. 
You fear not for your life and are at terms with death. When you are facing danger to your life, you have +1 ongoing to Defy Danger rolls.	You believe yourself a Hollow: nothing more than your armor. Perhaps you believe yourself a skeleton that remains fighting long after it's death, or perhaps simply armor that never lost it's will to fight.
	
	You take -2 ongoing on all Constitution rolls as you are no longer concerned with your physical form. 
You come from notable ancestry. This affords you some notoriety amongst the courts and townships. When you or a herald announces your arrival, you will find accommodations in the castle or township, unless you have given them a reason to be violently hostile.	You become obsessed with your pedigree and title. Maybe you take insult when someone doesn’t use your full heraldic name or maybe you  become despondent when you are not addressed properly. 
	
	When someone refers (even indirectly) to you, but doesn't address you by your full title, take -1 forward on your next roll as their "disrespect" throws you off.
