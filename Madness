Madness
One of the defining characteristics of this game is the Sanity/Madness mechanics. Your character will experience innumerable horrors that will put their mental fortitude to the test. By default, your character exists in the Sane state, gaining certain benefits that you pick when you made your character. However, when your character comes into a Horror (See page XXX), the Resist Horror Move will trigger. Failing the roll for this move, you will change to a state of Madness. Your Madness effect is chosen during character creation at the same time as your Sane effect. These two effects are generally contrasting and provide an insight into your character. These states also provide an oprotunity for roleplay. Playing into your character's mental state can provide an extra dimension to your character's personality. These ask a lot of the player. While they all have some gameplay component, they also ask that the player buy into playing up the effects in order for them to feel real. 

Horrors
A Horror is a mechanical piece that the GM may deploy to challenge the players to resist the Madness creeping into their character's mind. Horrors are set pieces that play into one of the base fears of humanity. Death, Plague, Famine, War are generally good places to look. Additionally, the unknown, the dark, body horror, uncanniness, loss, ostracization, and powerlessness also come to mind. Any fear that you are able to create a physical representation for the players to experience can be a Horror.
