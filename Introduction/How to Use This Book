If you are a Player you will probably want to read this intro section (paying special attention to the Setting section and  the Moves section) and the Playbook section to see your character options. Glancing at the equipment section would also not be too bad an idea. Beyond that, you just need a copy of your character's playbook and a pencil and you're ready to go. 

If you're the GM, you'll probably want to read the entire thing. But worry not! There are only a few areas that require special consideration when you are first starting out. I start with the same recommendation given to the Players above. You only really need to skim the Playbooks for now, but its still good to look them over. Next, I would read through the GM Aids sections. These cover the basics of the GM's role, along with a lot of helpful tips for running a horror game and nailing the tone of this setting. The last section to look at is the end of the book which contains some ideas and inspiration for both adventures and monsters. Once you've glanced over that, head back to the GM Advice section to start planning your first session.
